## Negative Binomial Distribution

```{r}
library(MASS)
```

### Random Sampling from the distrbution

```{r}
data <- rnegbin(100, mu = 10, theta = 2)
data
```

### Plot Histogram

```{r}
hist(data)
```

### Plot Log Histogram

```{r}
hist(log(data+1))
```

The mean of the dirstribution is `r mean(data)` and the variance is `r var(data)`
